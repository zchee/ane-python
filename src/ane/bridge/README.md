# ANE Training — Backpropagation on Apple Neural Engine

Training neural networks directly on Apple's Neural Engine (ANE) via reverse-engineered private APIs. No CoreML training APIs, no Metal, no GPU — pure ANE compute.

## Project Scope & Intent

I'm genuinely grateful for all the attention this project has received — I never expected a weekend research hack to blow up like this. Thank you to everyone who starred, forked, ran benchmarks on their own hardware, and shared the work. It means a lot.

That said, I want to set clear expectations about what this project is and isn't.

This is a **research project**, not a production framework.

The goal was to demonstrate that **training on the Apple Neural Engine — and potentially other NPUs — is possible**, and that the barrier has always been software support, not hardware capability. The ANE is a remarkably capable piece of silicon that Apple restricts to inference-only use through CoreML. This project bypasses that restriction using reverse-engineered private APIs to show what's possible when you give the hardware a chance.

### What this project is

- A proof of concept for ANE training via `_ANEClient` and `_ANECompiler` private APIs
- A set of benchmarks documenting real ANE performance characteristics (throughput, power, SRAM behavior)
- A reference for anyone exploring direct ANE access outside CoreML
- Research code that I update when I find something interesting

### What this project is not

- A maintained framework or library
- A replacement for CoreML, MLX, llama.cpp, or any production inference stack
- A path to training large models on consumer hardware (yet)

### On the hype

Some coverage of this project has overstated its implications. To be clear:

- Training works, but utilization is low (~2-3% of peak) with significant engineering challenges remaining
- Many element-wise operations still fall back to CPU
- This does **not** replace GPU training for anything beyond small research models today

The honest results — including all limitations — are documented in the accompanying articles:
- [Part 1: Reverse Engineering](https://maderix.substack.com/p/inside-the-m4-apple-neural-engine)
- [Part 2: Benchmarks](https://maderix.substack.com/p/inside-the-m4-apple-neural-engine-615)

### On maintenance

I don't intend to grow this into a large community project. My focus is on original research (compiler infrastructure for edge AI optimization), and maintaining an open-source framework takes time away from that.

That said:
- I'll keep pushing updates when I discover something interesting
- Bug fixes and benchmark contributions (especially on hardware I don't own) are welcome
- Feature requests will likely go unaddressed — but feel free to fork

### Fork it, build on it

This is MIT licensed for a reason. Everyone now has access to AI-assisted development tools that can adapt and extend code in hours. If this project is useful to you — take it, modify it, build something better. If you do something cool with it, I'd love to hear about it.

## What This Is

A from-scratch implementation of transformer training (forward + backward pass) running on the ANE in Apple Silicon. The ANE is a 15.8 TFLOPS (M4) inference accelerator that Apple does not expose for training. This project reverse-engineers the `_ANEClient` / `_ANECompiler` private APIs and the MIL (Model Intermediate Language) format to run custom compute graphs — including backpropagation — directly on ANE hardware.

**Current results (M4, single transformer layer, dim=768, seq=512):**
- 9.3 ms/step, 11.2% ANE utilization (1.78 TFLOPS sustained)
- 6 ANE kernel dispatches per training step
- All forward and backward dx passes on ANE, dW gradients on CPU (Accelerate cblas)
- Adam optimizer, gradient accumulation, checkpoint/resume

## Architecture

The training loop uses 6 ANE kernels per step:

| Kernel | Function | Weights |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `kFwdAttn` | RMSNorm + QKV projection + SDPA + output projection | Wq, Wk, Wv, Wo, rms1, mask |
| `kFwdFFN` | RMSNorm + SwiGLU FFN (W1, W3, SiLU, W2) | W1, W2, W3, rms2 |
| `kFFNBwd` | FFN backward (W2^T + SiLU_bwd + W1^T + W3^T) | W2^T, W1^T, W3^T |
| `kSdpaBwd1` | Wo^T + SDPA backward part 1 (dV, probs, dp) | Wo^T, mask |
| `kSdpaBwd2` | SDPA backward part 2 (softmax grad, dQ, dK) | — |
| `kQKVb` | QKV backward (Wq^T + Wk^T + Wv^T → dx) | Wq^T, Wk^T, Wv^T |

CPU handles: RMSNorm backward, residual connections, loss computation, dW gradient accumulation (cblas_sgemm), Adam optimizer updates.

Key optimizations:
- **Channel-first CPU layout** — matches ANE IOSurface `[1,C,1,S]` format, eliminates all transpose overhead
- **vDSP vectorized RMSNorm** — 10x faster than naive (6.7ms → 0.7ms)
- **GCD async cblas overlap** — dW gradient sgemms run in parallel with ANE evals on a serial dispatch queue
- **Deferred cblas wait** — wait pushed into next step's forward pass for maximum overlap
- **ANE RMSNorm fusion** — RMSNorm folded into forward kernels as MIL ops (reduce_sum + pow + mul)
- **Wo^T fusion** — output projection backward merged into SDPA backward kernel
- **Forward taps** — Q, K, V, attention scores, hidden states exposed via concat outputs, avoiding CPU recompute
- **exec() restart** — bypasses ~119 ANE compile limit per process

## Building

Requires macOS 15+ on Apple Silicon (tested on M4).

```bash
# Build the main training program
xcrun clang -O2 -framework Foundation -framework IOSurface \
  -framework CoreML -framework Accelerate -ldl -lobjc \
  -o train_large training/train_large.m

# Run
./train_large
```

No external dependencies. Uses only system frameworks + private ANE APIs resolved at runtime via `objc_msgSend`.

## How It Works

1. **MIL generation** — Objective-C code constructs MIL program text at runtime, specifying convolutions (for linear layers), matmul (for attention), softmax, element-wise ops
2. **In-memory compilation** — `_ANEInMemoryModelDescriptor` compiles MIL text + weight blobs directly to ANE programs, no disk mlmodelc needed
3. **IOSurface I/O** — Input/output tensors passed via IOSurface shared memory in `[1, channels, 1, spatial]` format (fp16)
4. **Weight embedding** — Weights baked into ANE programs as BLOBFILE constants; recompiled each batch when weights change
5. **Gradient flow** — Forward taps expose intermediates needed for backward; backward kernels compute dx (input gradients) on ANE; dW (weight gradients) computed on CPU via cblas

## Limitations

- **SDPA causal masking** — ANE hardware ignores `attn_mask` in SDPA ops; causal attention is decomposed into separate Q@K^T (ANE) → mask+softmax (ANE via add+softmax) → scores@V (ANE)
- **~119 compile limit** — ANE compiler leaks resources; worked around via `exec()` restart with checkpoint
- **Single layer** — Currently trains one transformer layer; multi-layer would need pipeline scheduling
- **Synthetic data** — Currently uses random data for benchmarking; real tokenized data support is WIP

## Performance History

| Optimization | ms/step | ANE util |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline (vDSP transpose) | 33.5 | 3.1% |
| Channel-first layout | 20.3 | 5.2% |
| vDSP vectorized RMSNorm | 14.2 | 7.4% |
| GCD async cblas overlap | 11.4 | 9.2% |
| ANE RMSNorm fusion | 11.4 | 9.2% |
| Wo^T fusion (7→6 kernels) | 11.4 | 9.2% |
| Deferred cblas wait | **9.3** | **11.2%** |
